# Bug report

## `bomber_bigloop.py`

### Bugs

1. The plane won't drop any bomb if the bomb does not hit the target
2. The plane cannot drop any bomb onto the most right building
3. When the plane landed, it could still run into a building
4. The game cannot restart as expected after pressing the according key
5. another building generated on the right-end of the screen blocked the plane

### what should happen

1. The bomb is supposed to be able to be dropped after the last one landed or hit the building
2. The plane should be able to drop bomb on the buildings of all the locations
3. When the plane successfully landed, it is not expected to hit any building
4. the game is supposed to restart when we press KEY_'r'
5. No building is expected to be generated outside the screen

### How to fix

1. reset `bomb_falling` to `False` when the bomb reach the bottom of the CANVAS [lien 246]

    ```py
    if (bomb_y >= CANVAS_HEIGHT or bomb_x <= 0 or bomb_x > CANVAS_WIDTH):
    # bomb landed
    bomb_falling = False
    ```

2. adjust the plane's initial position when born at a lower position [line 179]

    ```py
    plane_x += (CANVAS_WIDTH + plane_width)
    ```

3. if all the building height is lower or equal to 0, the game won't fail. [line 200]

    ```py
    building_remain = 0
    for building_num in range(0, 1200//SPACING):
                    
        if building_heights[building_num] <= 0:
            building_remain += 0
        else:
            building_remain += 1
                
    if building_remain == 0:
        game_running = True

    else:
        game_running  = False
        won = False
    ```

4. The error is caused by an undeclared variable `msg_text` [line 100]
    
    ```py
    canvas_exist = False
    while prog_running:
        .......
    elif ev.char == 'r':
            # restart the game

        if canvas_exist != False: # add an if to before the operation
            canvas.delete(msg_text)
            
        level = 1
        score = 0
        plane_x = plane_start_x
        plane_y = plane_start_y
        building_width = SPACING * 0.8
        rebuild_buildings = True
        won = False
        game_running = True
    ```

5. Check if all the building position is lower or equal to CANVAS HEIGHT. If yes, change the height to the position where the plane where never hit [line 156 ]

    ```py
    for building_num in range(0, 1200//SPACING):
            height = rand.randint(10,500) #random number between 10 and 500
            x = building_num*SPACING

            if (x + 80 > CANVAS_WIDTH):
                height = - CANVAS_HEIGHT
            # reset the height of the building that is outside the range of the window
    ```
